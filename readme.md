# Second Year Machine Learning Coursework

I have been investigating the use of two machine learning methods, Random Forest Classification (RFC) and Logistic Regression Classification (LRC) to predict the final result of a student. In the report [here](./report.pdf), I discuss and compare the two methods, in terms of their procedure and performance.

Find the final python script [here](./classifier.py).

## To run the script
* Obtain studentInfo.csv:

    Download dataset from https://analyse.kmi.open.ac.uk/open_dataset
    From the anonymisedData folder, move studentInfo.csv into the same directory as this file
    
    
* Install libraries as follows:

    `pip install pandas`
    
    `pip install seaborn`
    
    `pip install matplotlib`
    
    `pip install numpy`
    
    `pip install scikit-learn`
    
    
* Running the code:

    In the terminal, in the directory containing the code, run command `python classifer.py`.
    
    Graphs will be saved in the current directory
